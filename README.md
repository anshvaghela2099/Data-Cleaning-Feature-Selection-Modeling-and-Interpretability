# Data Cleaning, Feature Selection, Modeling, and Interpretability

## Overview

This notebook provides a comprehensive approach to building predictive models, focusing on **data cleaning**, **feature selection**, **modeling**, and **interpretability**. It uses the **Bank Customer Churn dataset** to classify whether a customer will churn based on various behavioral and financial attributes. The goal is to understand and interpret the factors driving customer churn while ensuring high model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

1. `CustomerID`
2. `Credit Score`
3. `Country`
4. `Gender`
5. `Age`
6. `Tenure`
7. `Balance`
8. `Product Number`
9. `Credit Card`
10. `Active Member`
11. `Estimated Salary`
12. `Churn` (Target variable)

## Key Features of the Notebook

- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, detects outliers, and ensures dataset consistency.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifies and selects the most relevant features using statistical methods and feature importance techniques.
- **Modeling**: Implements classification models, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
- **Interpretability**: Leverages tools like SHAP, ELI5, and permutation importance to explain model predictions and provide actionable insights.

## Requirements

This notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `eli5`
- `shap`
- `statsmodels`
- `missingno`

## Learning Outcomes

By working through this notebook, you will:

- Understand the importance of data cleaning and its impact on model performance.
- Learn how to perform feature selection to optimize predictive accuracy.
- Gain hands-on experience in training and evaluating classification models.
- Explore methods to interpret and explain model predictions for actionable insights.
